## Lessons Learned
-ArrayLists can make data manipulation much easier as compared to Arrays, but Arrays still have their place. Read more about Arrays vs ArrayLists [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-vs-arraylist-in-java/).</br>
-Reading from .txt files</br>

## Things That Could Be Improved
-Commends within code might not be descriptive enough</br>
-Could create more classes to represent different types of planes</br>
-Better presentation of Menu</br>
